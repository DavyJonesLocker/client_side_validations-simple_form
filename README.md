# ClientSideValidations-SimpleForm #

[![Build Status](http://travis-ci.org/dockyard/client_side_validations-simple_form.png)](http://travis-ci.org/dockyard/client_side_validations-simple_form)

[SimpleForm](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) plugin for [ClientSideValidations](https://github.com/bcardarella/client_side_validations)

## Installation ##

In your Gemfile add the following:

```ruby
gem 'simple_form'
gem 'client_side_validations'
gem 'client_side_validations-simple_form'
```

Order matters here. `SimpleForm` and `ClientSideValidations` need to be
required **before** `ClientSideValidations-SimpleForm`.

[Follow the remaining installation instructions for ClientSideValidations](https://github.com/bcardarella/client_side_validations/README.markdown)

Add the following line to `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`

```javascript
//= require rails.validations.simple_form
```

Again, order matters. You should add this line after the require for `rails.validations` as described in the `ClientSideValidations` installation instructions.

If the asset pipeline is disabled the asset file will be copied
into `public/javascripts` when the `ClientSideValidations` install generator is run.

At any time you can copy the asset file into your project by running:

```
rails g client_side_validations:copy_assets
```

If the asset pipeline is disabled the asset file will be copied
into `public/javascripts`. Otherwise the asset file will be copied into
`app/assets/javascripts` (or whatever asset directory you have
defined)

## Usage ##

The usage is the same as `ClientSideValidations`, just pass `:validate => true` to the form builder

```ruby
<%= simple_form_for @book, :validate => true |book| do %>
  <%= book.input :name %>
<% end %>
```

Per-input options are done with `:validate`

```ruby
<%= book.input :name, :validate => { :presence => true, :uniqueness => false }
```
